# Frozen Lake trained Q-Learning and DQN Models vs Custom Environment from Web Input

It's a reinforcement learning technology trained using their own intrinsic parameters and using the deterministic version of the frozen lake. After training, the model will be put in a custom environment to be observed of their performance on the new environment. The code for the dqn and qlearning can be found in backend/qlearning.py and backend/dqn.py

PS: ignore the . . folder in the backend folder. I accidentally copied all of the folder into the backend and I can't figure out how to undo it. Sorry.
